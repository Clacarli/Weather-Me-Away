ðŸŒˆ # Weather-Me-Away

A more refined and complete version of my weather app, which was all my programming adventure, so far but an illuminating experience.
It gave me also the empathy and understanding necessary to communicate to tech departments and other stakeholders involved in IT projects.

Communication and listening skills are the most challenging to cultivate but try wearing someone else's shoes, even if for just a day, and you will not be the same person again.
